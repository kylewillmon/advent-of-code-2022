# Advent of Code 2022

This is a repository of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022]. I am using this
year as an opportunity to gain experience with [Deno]. I am definitely **not**
an expert here. Feel free to look around, but I make no promises about code
function or quality.

If you are looking for previous events, see my [other AoC repos].
